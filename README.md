# Wilson-algorithm-RSF

I reproduced a modified version of the Wilson's algorithm, 
in order to sample Random Spanning Forests over a 2d lattice graph.
The code is written in Python.

LIST OF FILES:

- Wilson's Algorithm RSF on 2d grid.ipynb - 
Notebook with functions to simulate the algorithm 

- An algorithmic approach to the random spanning forests.pdf - 
My Master thesis project, with the explanation of Wilson's algorithm 
and mathematical proof that it is a sampling algorithm for the
Random Spanning Forest (chapter 3)

- wilsonRSF.py - 
Python file containing all the functions I implemented
